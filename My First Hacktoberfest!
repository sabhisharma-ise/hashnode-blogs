### 📌How I Discovered Hactoberfest?
My experience at Hacktoberfest was incredible.<br />
10th of August, an event was conducted in my college, with the intention of spreading info about the awesome Hacktoberfest event which takes place every year. Very excitedly, I actively took part in the event and made my first-ever Pull Request. In the same event, I learned some basic Git Commands, and how to use GitHub. That's where my open source journey begins.

### 📌 Hacktoberfest Experience
My dedication for Hacktoberfest was so strong, that I got over 20-30 issues assigned to me in my whole journey! The reason being, I went to a lot of repositories and check for the issues (which levelled up to my skill-level) and then requested the maintainer to assign the issues to me. And by doing so, I was consistently able to get so many issues assigned to me. After getting assigned, I worked on those issues with my whole-some dedication and got them merged within a few days. This journey of getting pull requests merged and accepted was so incredible that it even motivates me to take part in coming open-source events like GSOC'23 and more.
